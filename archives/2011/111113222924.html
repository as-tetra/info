			<p><strong>Dario Elia</strong><br />
As musician, singer, composer and producer, Dario Elia is an important part of the experimental/improv scene in Italy. His music has been often compared to David Sylvian, Nick Cave, Mike Patton, Brian Eno and Robert Fripp. He has a huge number of active collaborations with many international musicians and sound artists. In the last two years, he was extensively touring in Italy, Russia, Spain, Serbia, Thailand and now in Japan for the first time.His songwriting borders on the avant-garde jazz and on ambient art-rock. Minimalist and psychedelic elements, sound installations, natural acoustic sounds, emotive electronica, multilingual lyrics and hypnotic beats, make his style highly recognizible.<a href="http://www.myspace.com/darioelia ">www.myspace.com/darioelia </a></p>

★mail interview with Dario Elia</p>

<p><br />
<strong>- I heard that your musical activities begun in the early 90s. Did you begin in Sardinia or somewhere else?</strong></p>

<p>Yes, it all started in Cagliari in those years with an avant-rock band called Versus, influenced by bands such as Primus and Living Colour. We were teenagers and we were certainly not artistically mature. Despite this and despite the very small number of live performances, this group became to some extent a cult band in the Cagliari scene of those years, we were broadcasted by the Italian national radio and received a sponsorship to go to London.</p>

<p><br />
<strong>- What kind of music is your music related to? In Italy, you have great avant-garde musical heritage (maybe from futurist Luigi Russolo to Nono, Berio, Evangelisti to Mario Schiano, Giancarlo Schiaffini to Area, Stormy Six to much more). Is your Background more to be seen in a </strong></p>

<p>My initial background was quite unusual. My family did not usually listen to music and my first musical passion as a teenager were some great composers of the 20th century (especially Igor Stravinsky, Charles Ives, Edgard Varese, Bela Bartok and Steve Reich) and the British prog-rock. Only later I met the great Italian avant-garde movements, jazz and many other forms of experimental music.</p>

<p>Also the cinema somehow has had a profound effect on my approach to music, I think of great directors that can talk about reality by suspending beautifully the sense of it as Hiroshi Teshigahara, Ingmar Bergman Aleksei German and Federico Fellini, to name a few.</p>

<p><br />
<strong>- Do you have a local musical scene in Sardinia? Do you think you belong to it, and in what kind of places do you usually play? </strong></p>

<p> In my opinion, in the early '90s you could talk about a musical scene in Cagliari, mainly oriented towards the avant-rock sung in Italian. To talk about a "scene", however, it is not enough that there are a number of bands or individual musicians with a musical orientation that somehow brings them together, it is necessary that there are also live venues where this scene is commonly accepted. This was the fact in those years. The music clubs were few but they were real live music venues designed to present music or other artistic events. </p>

<p>Over the past 15 years the situation has changed completely, now there are a lot of music clubs where you can play but they are not real live venues any more. They are simply bars or restaurants where the music has just a peripheral function or that of a mere entertainment. Unfortunately, a similar phenomenon occurred in some way throughout Italy. Places of culture as active performing arts spaces, intermedia art spaces, real live venues are few left. In my humble opinion, in the field of experimental music today there are no more than 20-30 real live venues throughout the Italian territory. I also don't see many festivals in Italy with a varied and daring programmes. Too many festivals propose an offer "behind closed doors", where words always praise the contaminated music but actually different musical environments (jazz, ethnic music, non-jazz improv, avant-rock, electronic music,...) barely touch each other. A sort of musical xenophobia.</p>

<p>Certainly, the cultural budget cuts that have been made in the Italian Berlusconi era were incredibly aggressive and harmful. But what happened is not only an economic phenomenon, I think it is also sociological. If the '80s were the years of yuppie subculture in Italy, the later period has been the era of the ephemeral, non-thinking entertainment and distraction at all costs. But I am optimistic, because now I see signs of reaction in my country after almost 20 years of hibernation. </p>

<p>Regarding the second question, in the last two years I played mainly abroad in Spain, Russia, Serbia, Thailand and now in Japan. Of course, I played even in Italy, but somehow it was more difficult to work in my own country than abroad. The places where I play are most frequently theaters (in the case of the festivals) and performing arts centers or other types of live music venues open to experimental and intermedia art.</p>

<p><br />
<strong>- Sardinia evoke us who are foreigners a very mystical image. Nuraghes culture tells an ancient atmosphere. Although it is famous as a tourist city, since it is an island, I heard that there is an economical gap with the Italy mainland. Do you think that there is relationship between such social background of Sardinia and your music? </strong></p>

<p>Yes, there is an economical gap. Generally not between Sardinia and the mainland but between the south of the country (Sardinia included) and the richer north.But actually Sardinia is not Italy from many evident point of views, so the difference is a lot deeper than an economical gap. </p>

<p>Sardinian language and culture is a lot older than italian language and culture. Also the island is the less populated region of Italy.Sardinian territory is still very wild and moving through the island was very difficult for centuries because of the little number of real roads.So for centuries Sardinia the different small communities into the island were not interacting a lot, creating a lot of isolated "islands" into the island. In some way Japan lived in its history a similar situation were different parts of the island were isolated or choosing for self-isolation.</p>

<p>The sardinian society was always based mainly on wild sheep-farming and agriculture. Still today there are three millions of sheep on the island. The sheperds were spending a long time alone in the mountains and far from their families. This had a huge sociological effect on sardinian people and mentality. Sardinian communities are not rich but they are very independent and autonomous. Solidarity is strong and exchange of help, favours and food is still incredibly common. From this point of view, Sardinia still have many advantages of a primitive ethical society. This is why the economical gap is not so evident. </p>

<p>Actually the life-style is deeply different from the big cities in the mainland, and life in Sardinia can be a lot easier in many cases. But this is just my humble opinion. Every year, I spend almost six months travelling in Italy and around the world, and sincerely I cannot imagine a most inspiring place for living in Italy than Sardinia. </p>

<p>The link between my music and Sardinia is not related to some kind of regionalism, or nationalism, or pride. I think the relationship between my humble art and this island is really pagan, it is just a relationship with its Nature, it is inspiring and it is part of the core of my happiness. </p>

<p><br />
<strong>- What do you mean by "pagan"</strong></p>

<p>One of my deeper music influences was eastern european modern music, not just famous composers like Stravinsky and Bartok, but also a lot of folk music coming from Russia, Serbia, Bulgaria,... Some of this folk music was actually a big influence for those two composers as well. From my point of view, one of the most interesting aspect of this "pagan" musical primitivism so evident in Stravinsky and Bartok, was the creation of terribly powerful melodies without ever falling into banality or fake sentimentalism.<br />
I used the word "pagan" not referring to a specific cult but as an approach to Nature. There is a common level of consciousness, a real link, between many forms of different spirituality like Shinto, Roman and Greek pre-christian pantheisms, African traditional cults, Native American religions, Taoism and many others. This common level of consciousness is about Nature. In this level, a human being feel that there is no separation between him and Nature and between him and others. From this perspective a human being can perceive himself as an extension of the environment. From this perspective a human being can love and create in a better way. I believe that trying to get near to this level of consciousness is a tool for happiness and creativity.</p>

<p><br />
<strong>- It seems that you have performed with Japanese musicians. Why did such experiences happen?</strong></p>

<p>Everything happened very naturally. But surely my deep love for Japanese culture, and in particular for many forms of Japanese art of the 20th century, has played a role in making me more open to any kind of collaboration.The first collaboration came about some years ago with Koichi Shimizu, a sound artist living in Thailand. Koichi has embarked on a collaborative international sound and visual installation called Sol.</p>

<p>From the early music cells of Sol, designed by Koichi and myself, the idea has been developed involving other vocalists, photographers and video artists. The result is a work of intermedia art that term has not ceased to evolve itself and continued its transformation over the past year. The first installation of Sol took place in Bangkok in 2008. In this original version four singers celebrate the theme of sun in four different languages: Alma Laprida (Argentina) in Spanish, Itta (Korea) in Korean, Orkun Tuzel (Turkey) in Turkish and I in Italian. In my part I quote one of the most embarrassing and controversial pages of the Bible, the episode in which God stopped the sun to allow his people to take revenge and destroy the enemy, a real hymn to violence and revenge. Antithetically, I sing a part exposing the ability to be reborn from our enemies, the possibility of becoming brothers of those who we once considered enemies. </p>

<p>Several other collaborations are open at the moment with exceptional Japanese musicians of very various kind, and I hope to be able to publish the results soon. Among these musicians, the composer Tomohisa Ishikawa, the pianist Akiko Matsushita and the noise artist Yoshihiro Nakatani.</p>

<p>This year I had the pleasure of setting up a sound installation based on the sounds of Toru Takemitsu manipulated in real time, in the lobby of the theater of Udine (Italy) during the Far East Film Festival, one of the main Asian film festivals in Europe. Finally, the upcoming tour in Japan this November will be an opportunity for new experiences and collaborations.</p>

<p><br />
<strong>- Do you have any impressions about Japanese music (scene)? And why did you think that you would like to perform in Japan?</strong></p>

<p> I see the Japanese scene as a very varied and interesting one. Two particular things I really like about it: the first is that is very easy to find bold and uncompromising music, the second is that producing music for mere entertainment appear less evident in Japan compared to countries such as Italy or US. I'm not saying that art can not produce entertainment, but if on the contrary entertainment becomes a necessary condition for art that creates an upsetting situation.</p>

<p><strong>- Please explain about relationship between entertaiment and art in detail.</strong></p>

<p>f we call entertainment any activity which provides a diversion or permits people to amuse themselves, we can accept that some art can produce a form of fun and active entertainment. But we never have to accept that mere entertainment take the place of artistical expression. An italian right-wing ministry recently said: "With culture you do not eat". This myopic and totally false idea, that culture does not bring money to the country, is just an excuse to substitute pluralism and cultural richness with mere entertainment. For instance: "Why should we distribute in italian cinemas twenty different interesting independent american movies when we can distribute a single stupid Hollywood movie?" For instance: "Why should we distribute in italian cinemas twenty different interesting independent american movies when we can distribute a single stupid Hollywood movie?"</p>

<p><br />
<strong>- I think that actually the musical situation in Japan is similar to in Italy you wrote. Surely Avant-music in Japan seem to be well-known in Europe and U.S., I think that fame is higher than demestic unfortunately. </strong></p>

<p>I can easily believe it. Actually I thought the same when you asked me a question referring to Luciano Berio, Luigi Nono and other Italian avant-garde composers. These great composers are still incredibly unknown, or ignored, in Italy. I was in Tokyo with some Japanese friends two years ago, and I have to say that my impression was very good when I spended time in different live venues, many different music genres, a lot of original music. </p>

<p><br />
<strong>- Do have any impressions about the differences between free improv in a jazz context and late electro-acoustic improv.?</strong></p>

<p>Many jazz contexts suffer from the fact that jazz music has become institutionalized. When something is gradually institutionalized a series of self-destructive phenomena such as conservatism and purism occur. Fortunately, many areas of jazz can live outside that excessively codified language that threatens a big part of jazz music. Obviously, the excess of fixed codes and patterns can easily become a cage. That is why I find that forms of improv disjointed from jazz are often more fresh and unpredictable.</p>

<p><br />
<strong>- In what extend do you want the audience to enjoy your music?</strong></p>

<p>Generally I try to listen, listen with the spirit and the curiosity of a child, and I hope that others listen too. I agree with the idea of Picasso that it takes a long time to become young.</p>

<p><br />
<strong>- The Dutch free improviser Han Bennink says "Free Jazz keeps you young". It's a joke, but do you have any idea about your music "effect"?</strong></p>

<p>For those who work like me with modal music, the different atmosphere, and then the different effects you are trying to produce both in improvisation and composition can be largely premeditated.The sense of the dream is perhaps the most fascinating to me.Bennink's humor is famous, and contains a simple truth. Creativity in any form, makes human beings alive and vital.</p>

<p>私のバックグラウンドはとても変わっています。私の家庭は音楽をよく聞くような家庭ではありませんでした。ティーンエイジャーとしての音楽への最初の情熱は20世紀の大作曲家（ストラヴィンスキー、アイヴス、ヴァレーズ、バルトーク、ライヒ）やイギリスのプログレッシヴ・ロックへのものでした。それから少ししてイタリアの偉大な前衛音楽のムーヴメントやジャズ、その他のエクスペリメンタルな音楽へと移って行きました。それから映画が私の音楽に対するアプローチに大きな影響を与えたと思います。勅使河原宏、イングマール・ベルイマン、アレクセイ・ゲルマン、フェデリコ・フェリーニ等々の、美しい方法を用い現実感を宙吊りにすることで、（通常の）現実感自体を問題化した偉大な映画作家のことが思い浮かびます。</p>

<p><br />
<strong>―　サルデーニャにはあなたが関わるような音楽のローカルシーンのようなものはありますか？また、いつもどのようなところで演奏していますか？</strong></p>

<p>90年代の初めには、カリアリにイタリア語でアバン・ロックをやるシーンがあったといえると思います。「シーン」というもの考える場合、互いに同じような方向性を持ったバンドや個人がいるだけでなく、そのシーンの求心力となる場所が必要だとおもいます。当時そのような場所がありました。音楽をやるクラブは少なかったですが、音楽やアート・イベントをやる素晴らしい「本物の」ライブスポットがありました。</p>

<p>しかし、この15年で状況は一変しました。現在、音楽を出し物にするクラブは数多くありますが「本物の」場所はもうありません。多くのバーやレストランで音楽は添え物か単なるエンターテイメントとして扱われています。残念なことに似たような現象はイタリア中で起こっています。アクティブなパフォーミング・アート、インターメディア・アート、「本物の」ライブスポットとしての場所はもう数えるほどしかありません。控えめにいって、イタリアではエクスペリメンタルな音楽をやる場所は20～30ほどでしょう。最近イタリアでは冒険的であったり、多彩なプログラムの音楽フェスを見ることが少なくなりました。多くのフェスは異なる音楽（ジャズ、エスニック、ノン―ジャズ・インプロ、アヴァン・ロック、電子音楽）がむき出しでせめぎあうのではなく、飼いならされた音楽（contamineted music）を賞賛する声が充満する「閉じた場所」と化してしまいました。音楽における一種の排他主義が蔓延しています。</p>

<p>確かに、ベルルスコーニ政権が行っている文化予算の削減は非常に悪辣なものです。しかし、今まさに起こりつつあるのは経済的な現象であるだけでなく、思うに社会学的分析が必要なものでもあるとおもいます。もし80年代のイタリアがヤッピーのサブカルチャー全盛の時代であったなら、それに続く時代（90年代？）は刹那的で、中身のないエンターテイメントの時代となったでしょう。しかし、私は楽観しています。最近、この20年の停滞期に対する反動の兆候を感じているからです。</p>

<p>質問についてですが、この2年私は主に海外（スペイン、ロシア、セルビア、タイ）で演奏し、そして今度日本行きます。もちろんイタリアでも演奏しますが、海外で行うよりむしろ困難を伴うといわなければなりません。多くが（フェスティバル等での）劇場、またはエクスペリメンタルな音楽やインターメディア・アートにもオープンなパフォーミング・アーツ・センター、ライブハウスのような場所です。</p>

<p><br />
<strong>―　サルデーニャは私たち外国人からみると、とても神秘的なイメージがあります。ヌラーヘ人の文化は太古の息吹を伝えてくれます。また、観光都市として有名ですが島である故、イタリア本土と経済的な格差があるとも聞きました。このような社会的な背景があなたの音楽になんらかの関係がるといえますか？</strong></p>

<p><img alt="tumblr_lswodt9qJ41qlh5va%281%29.jpg" src="/upload/2011/tumblr_lswodt9qJ41qlh5va%281%29.jpg" width="183" style="float:left; margin: 0 10px 10px 0;" />確かに経済的な格差があります。しかしそれはサルデーニャと本土の間というより、（サルデーニャを含む）南部の裕福な北部の間といえるでしょう。サルデーニャはいろいろな明白な観点において、イタリアとはいえません。つまり、その違いは経済的な面よりも根深いものです。サルデーニャの言語や文化はイタリアの言語や文化より古いものです。また、イタリアの島嶼部にはあまり人が居住していません。サルデーニャはいまだに原野が多くを占め、道といえるものが数えるほどしかないため何世紀もの間島内の移動は困難を伴いました。したがって、サルデーニャ島内のコミュニティー間でも交流はなく、各コミュニティーは島内においても「島」同様でした。島内の各部分が孤立したり、孤立を選んだりするような状況は日本の歴史においても見られるものでしょう。</p>

<p>サルデーニャの社会は主に羊の放牧や農業を基盤としてきました。現在でも100万頭の羊が飼われています。羊飼いは長い時間家族と離れて一人ぼっちで過ごしますが、このことはサルデーニャの人々やメンタリティに社会学的にみて大きな影響を与えているとおもいます。サルデーニャのコミュニティーは裕福ではありませんが独立心、自立心は旺盛です。団結心が強固でコミュニティー内の互助が現在でも見られます。つまり、サルデーニャはプリミティヴな民族社会の良さを現在でも持ち続けているといえるでしょう。これがサルデーニャにおいて経済的な格差がそれほど問題にされない理由だとおもいます。実際、本土の都会とライフスタイルの面で大きな違いがあり、ある面ではより生活し易いところです。もちろんこれは私の個人的な意見ですが。毎年、私は半年間イタリア本土や世界を旅していますが、正直なところサルデーニャをおいてイタリアでインスパイアされる場所を思い浮かべることができません。</p>

<p>私の音楽とサルデーニャに何がしかの関係があるとすれば、それはリージョナリズムやナショナリズム、誇りの気持ちに関するものではありません。私のささやかな作品とこの島との関係性は、「異境（教）性（pagan）」にあるとおもいます。それは自然と関係することであり、とても触発され、私が幸せだと感じる核心の一部をなすといえます。</p>

<p><br />
<strong>―　「異境（教）性」について詳しくお聞かせください。</strong></p>

<p>ストラヴィンスキーやバルトーク等の著名な作曲家だけでなく、ロシア、セルビア、ブルガリア等のフォーク・ミュージックを含む東欧の現代の音楽に私は深い影響を受けました。あるフォーク・ミュージックからの強い影響は、先の2人作曲家と同等だとおもいます。私の意見では、ストラヴィンスキーやバルトークの音楽に表現される異境（教）音楽的プリミティヴィズムの面白さは、ありきたりでセンチメンタルな表現に堕すことなく、恐ろしいほどに強烈なメロディーを創造するところにあるとおもいます。</p>

<p>神道、ギリシャ・ローマ時代の前キリスト教時代の汎神論的諸宗教、アフリカの伝統的な祭式集団、ナイティヴ・アメリカンの信仰、道教等々、霊性に関する様々な教えには、ある意識についてのレベル、「リアル・リンク」の考えが共通して見られます。この意識についてのレベルは自然に関するものです。このレベルでは、人は彼自身と自然、彼自身と他の人々が一体になったように感じ、さらには彼自身世界（環境）の一部なのだと悟り、より良く愛し、創造するとされています。私は、この意識のレベルに近づくことが幸福や創造性への道筋なのだとおもいます。</p>

<p><br />
<strong>－　日本人と演奏した経験があるようですが、どういった経緯だったのですか？</strong></p>

<p>偶然だったのですが、ひょっとすると私が日本文化を好んでいること、特に20世紀の日本のアートに興味があることがきっかけとなったかもしれません。最初は数年前、タイ在住のサウンド・アーティスト<a href="http://www.webdice.jp/dice/detail/3121/">清水宏一</a>とコラボレーションしました。清水はSOLという協同的で国際的なサウンド、ヴィジュアルに関するプロジェクト（スペース）を行っています。初期のSOLの音楽のセルを清水と私でデザインしました。このアイデアはヴォーカリストや写真家、ヴィデオ・アーティストを巻き込みながら発展していきました。その結果、このプロジェクトは数年間進化し、変化し続けることになるインターメディア作品といえるものになりました。</p>

<p>SOLの最初のインスタレーションは2008年バンコクで行われました。オリジナルヴァージョンでは、4人のシンガーがそれぞれ異なる4つの言語（アルマ・ラプリダがスペイン語、イッタが韓国語、オルクン・トゥゼルがトルコ語、そして私がイタリア語）で太陽を祝福するものです。私のパートでは、聖書の最も難解で物議を醸している断片を引用しました。（ヨシュア記の）神が人々（ギベオン人）が敵（アムル人）に復讐できるように太陽を静止させるエピソード、暴力と復讐の賛歌とされる箇所です。私は敵の再生が可能であること、敵対しあうものが兄弟となる可能性を強調するような逆説的な表現をしました。</p>

<p>その他様々なスタイルの特異なミュージシャン（石川智久（テクノボーイズ）、ピアノのマツシタ・アキコ、ノイズのナカタニ・ヨシヒロ等）とコラボレーションしました。これらは近々発表したいとおもいます。今年はヨーロッパで権威のあるアジア映画フェスの一つ「ファー・イースト・フィルム・フェスティヴァル」の期間に、ウディーネの劇場のロビーでリアルタイム操作される武満徹の音楽をベースにしたサウンド・インスタレーションをする機会がありました。それから、今回の日本ツアーで新しい経験やコラボレーションが行えるでしょう。</p>

<p><br />
<img alt="tumblr_lswo97NO6Z1qlh5va%281%29.jpg" src="/upload/2011/tumblr_lswo97NO6Z1qlh5va%281%29.jpg" width="183" style="float:left; margin: 0 10px 10px 0;" /><strong>―　日本の音楽やシーンについて何か印象をお持ちですか？また、なぜ日本で演奏しようと思ったのですか？</strong></p>

<p>日本のシーンは、多様でとても興味深いものです。特に2つの点で。1つ目は、挑戦的で妥協のない音楽が多いこと。2つ目はイタリアやアメリカに比べ、エンターテイメントのためだけの音楽が少ないように感じることです。アートがエンターテイメントを生みだすことができないとは言いませんが、もしその逆ならば、エンターテイメントは転倒的な状況を創造するアートの必要条件となるでしょう。</p>

<p><br />
<strong>―　エンターテイメントとアートの関係についてもう少し詳しくお聞かせください。</strong></p>

<p>もしエンターテイメントが気晴らしやただ楽しみを提供する全ての活動を意味するなら、アートが楽しみやアクティブなエンターテイメントを生み出すものであることを受け入れるでしょう。しかし、エンターテイメントだけがアーティスティックな表現を独占することには承諾できません。あるイタリアの右翼の指導者が「文化では食えない」と言いました。文化が国に富をもたらさないという、この狭量で完全に誤った考えは多元主義や文化的な豊かさを単なるエンターテイメントに置き換えるための口実です。たとえば、たった1本のくだらないハリウッド映画より、20本の様々なおもしろいアメリカのインディペンデント映画を配給してはどうでしょう？</p>

<p><br />
<strong>―　日本における音楽の状況もあなたがおっしゃるイタリアの状況と似ているとおもいます。確かに、日本のアヴァンギャルドな音楽はヨーロッパやアメリカでよく知られているようですね。しかし、それは国内でのものより高いものと感じます。</strong></p>

<p>確かに、それはわかります。あなたがルチアーノ・ベリオやルイジ・ノーノ、その他のアヴァンギャルドな作曲を例示しながら質問をされたときに私も同じ印象を受けました。信じられないことですがイタリア国内では、この偉大な作曲家たちはいまだに知られておらず、さもなくば注目されていません。2年前、日本の友人を訪ね東京に滞在しました。その際、いろいろなライヴ・スポットで様々な音楽ジャンル、多くのオリジナルな音楽に接する機会があり、とても良い印象を持ちました。</p>

<p><br />
<strong>―　ジャズをルーツとする即興音楽と最近のエレクトロ・アコースティックな即興の違いに関し、印象がありますか？</strong></p>

<p>多くのジャズのコンテクストはジャズが制度化されていることに捕らえられています。物事が制度化されていくほど、保守主義や純血主義のような自己破壊的な事象が起こるものです。幸いジャズは、それ自身を破壊に至らしめる過度にコード化されたランゲージの外側でも生き続けています。明らかなことですが、過度の固定化したコードやパターンは檻同様です。ジャズから別れた即興のフォルムのほうが、フレッシュで予測困難と私は感じます。</p>

<p><br />
<strong>―　あなたは音楽のどのようなところを楽しんで欲しいですか?</strong> </p>

<p>私はいつも子供のようなスピリットと好奇心を持って聞こうとしています。他の人にもそのようにしてほしいです。私はピカソが「若くなるためには時間がかかる」と言ったのに賛同します。</p>

<p><br />
<strong>―　ハン・ベニンクは「フリー・ジャズは若さを保たせてくれる」と言いました。ジョークともいえますが、音楽の「効果」に関して、何か考えはありますか？</strong></p>

<p>モーダル（モード）・ミュージックに取り組み、様々なアトモスフィア、したがって様々な効果（状況）と関わる私のような音楽家は、即興と作曲をうまく組み合わせるようにします。ひょっとすると夢の感覚が一番私を魅了しているのではないでしょうか。ベニンクのユーモアは有名ですね。そこにはシンプルな真理があると思います。創造性はいかなる形式であれ、人に生命力を与え、活き活きとさせるものです。</p>
